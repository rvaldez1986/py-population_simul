# py-population_simul
Python based simulator for population transition (markov chains)

We use object oriented programming and markov chains to simmulate a population behavior. Population at each staged get stored and can be used to analyze either income or costos resulting from the stage-population mix. The program outputs grid plots and pyramid graphs to diplay the evolution of the population.
